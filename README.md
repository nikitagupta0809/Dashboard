# Dashboard
This is a dashboard developed in React and Redux to visualize sales. 

# Technologies:
1. ReactJS
2. ReduxJS
3. D3

# Functionality:
The data is read from a JSON file and dynamically the web page is updated. The Redux store can be used to update the chart. As not mentioned in the requirements, I didn't work on that but set that up. The store is set and an "attribute" is set when a Tab is created. This attribute can be used to update the chart. I have used D3 to render the line chart and React to create the components. 

# Future Ideas:
1. Implementation of the overview v/s sales tab selection through React Router. I tried to stick to the requirements but this can be easily implmented.
2. I have kept the table simple but the headers can have an arrow to sort in ascending or descending order.
3. The Redux store can be used to update the chart.
